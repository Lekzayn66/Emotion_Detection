Project Title: Emotion Detection from Facial Images (Happy, Sad & Angry)

Introduction:
Emotion detection from facial images has gained momentum as an area of research in 
the field of computer vision to describe human emotions from deep learning. The area 
of study of this project is to name three main emotions; happy, sad and angry, on the 
basis of facial expressions. It has practical application on ground in customer care, 
education, mental health and security.

Problem Statement:
Facial expression, the way humans are capable of conveying emotions, is not a feature 
most machines possess. We need systems that can recognize emotions from facial cues 
to improve human-computer interaction.

Aim:
To develop a deep learning model that can classify facial images into happy, sad, or 
angry emotions.

Expected Outcome Usage:
Output is hoped to be a model trained to detect expressions of happy, sad or angry faces 
in facial images. This can be harnessed to work in such real-life applications like:
Emotion-aware customer service systems
Classroom engagement analysis
Mental health monitoring tools
Smart surveillance and security systems

Objectives:
To collect and pre-process facial image datasets.
To design and train a CNN for classifying emotions.
To evaluate and optimize model performance.
To explore practical use cases for emotion detection.

Scope of the Project:
The project will focus on detecting three emotions happy, sad, and angry, using static 
facial images. It will involve training and testing a CNN model using publicly available 
datasets and exploring basic real-world use cases.

Methodology:
Data Collection: Use the FER-2013 dataset.
Pre-processing: Resize images
Model Building: Design and train a CNN for emotion classification.
Evaluation: Use metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix to assess 
performance.

Conclusion:
This project will develop the practical skills of the deep learning through an emotional 
classification task. It helps to develop emerging sphere AI-human interaction and has 
useful implications in customer service, in education, in mental health and others. The 
project shows how deep learning can be used to understand human behavior better with 
the detection of emotions such as happy, sad and angry
